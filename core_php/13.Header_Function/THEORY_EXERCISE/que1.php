What is the header function in PHP and how is it used?  

ans:
In PHP, the header() function is used to send raw HTTP headers to the client (typically the browser). HTTP headers are part of the response sent by the server, and they provide information about the content being sent or instruct the browser to take specific actions, such as redirecting to another page or specifying the content type of the response.

The header() function is essential for controlling various aspects of the HTTP response, including content type, redirection, caching policies, and more.
